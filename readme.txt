This Housecat software is the low level Housecat PLC interfacing layer between a domitics application situated at a higher level.
While the higher application layer can be any domotics application, the Housecat deamon tries to be independant from any application and still easy to set up on any Housecat PLC.   

Housecat PLC is a DIN rail module based on a creditcard size open-source Linux controller platform which can be plugged into the circuit board. 
This method gives you instant access to the onboard GPIOs. Our starting point is the Raspberry pi 3 but we like to implement other boards, for example: beaglebone, Odroid ...  which we also want to implement in this software..


Anyone can contribute or use this softaware to interface your own raspberry Pi, Beaglebone or Odroid.


The Housecat deamon software is open source software and licend under the GNU General Public licence (GNU).
